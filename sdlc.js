// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const AnalysisOfRequirements = `This is the second step, where you will a list of requirements for the code you might set up minimum specs and maximum specs.`

const Design = `in this step you might set up the outline for the code its self and begin coding and puting together pieces.`

const Implementation = `in this step you will connect the code the the wider system`

const TestingAndIntegration = `in this step you will test the the code within the wider system to check for any bugs and vulnerabilities`

const Maintain = `this step will last until the end of the softwares life with bug fixes updates and redesigns.`
